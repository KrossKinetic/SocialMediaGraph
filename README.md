# SocialMediaGraph
SocialMediaGraph is a simple program written in Java for simulating a social media network between people (with followers and followings) using graphs.
It demonstrates the following skills:

1. Graph Traversal (DFS)    
2. Adjacency Matrix    
3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm    
4. File I/O    
5. Comparators    
6. Serialization    
7. Data Structures (ArrayList, boolean[][], etc.)

## Original Question
TWITTOR is a social media site that is built on top of its proprietary "Follow Graph". This Graph is composed of users, who are the vertices and follows, that are modeled as the edges. Whenever one user of the site follows someone else, an edge between the follower and the followed is established. This edge is directed from the follower to the user being followed.

Your program must be persistent.
